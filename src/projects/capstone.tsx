          <p>
            For the culmination of my Bachelors Degree for Electrical And
            Computer Engeering, I Worked with three other students to plan,
            design, and create a Capstone Design Project that employed skills I
            have learned throughout my 5 years at The Ohio State University.
            After much deliberation, my team decided to address issues
            surrounding Marathon Gas Companies current process involving
            calibrating their gas sensors. The issue stems from the exposure to
            Harmful H2S (Hydrogen Sulphide) gas that Marathon employees face
            working within the field. The gas sensors they use to detect H2S gas
            need to be calibrated every 30 days to ensure they remain
            functional. Maraton's calibration process includes placing their
            sensors onto the calibration bench, which would then release small
            amounts of H2S gas into the air without any protection for the
            employee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of this, my team and I designed a containment chamber that
            would house the calibration bench, and contain the H2S Released.
            During the design phase, our team designated 4 major subsystems for
            the project: The Chamber Itself, The Control System, The Disposal
            System, and the Human Machine Interface. I was responsible for the
            Human Machine Interface, which would allow the user to interact with
            the system, and monitor the calibration process. Unfortunately, due
            to university restrictions on funding and gas acquisition, we were
            unable to fully implement the Disposal/Control System, and H2S was
            too dangerous to use. H2 gas was instead used as a substitute to
            demonstrate a proof of concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Human Machine Interface, I decided to utilize a Python,
            PyQt6, and a Raspberry Pi 4. Our team purchased a 7 inch touch
            screen display, aswell as a POSIFA HGS1004 Hydrogen Sensor which
            connected to the GPIO Pins on the raspberry pi. The Sensor utilized
            I2C Communication protocol and was used to communicate with the
            python script in order to implement a live graph of H2 Gas levels
            within the chamber, and determine when the calibration process was
            complete. The interface also included an event log, that tracks each
            calibration process, and writes important information about each
            calibration to a text file. This text file is also used to recreate
            the live graph of H2 Gas levels, and display it to the user, along
            with any warnings generated throughout the process.
